 Yes, you can run python3 run_example.py, but you have several options depending on what you want to
  do:

  üöÄ Running Options:

  Option 1: Example Script (Interactive)

  python3 run_example.py
  - Walks you through the full setup process
  - Handles OAuth authentication interactively
  - Generates a report and asks if you want to start the scheduler

  Option 2: CLI Commands (Recommended)

  # First time setup and authentication
  python3 run_cli.py setup

  # Generate a single report from Focus folder
  python3 run_cli.py generate --focus --email

  # Generate from all feeds
  python3 run_cli.py generate --all --email

  # Start daily scheduler
  python3 run_cli.py schedule --time "08:00" --start

  Option 3: Test the System First

  # Test if everything is working
  python3 test_focus_folder.py

  # Test configuration
  python3 test_system.py

  üìã Recommended First-Time Workflow:

  1. Test the system:
  python3 test_system.py
  2. Check Focus folder:
  python3 test_focus_folder.py
  3. Run initial setup:
  python3 run_cli.py setup
  4. Generate your first report:
  python3 run_cli.py generate --focus --email

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

  - Environment setup: Make sure you run with the correct PATH:
  export PATH="/home/joel/.local/bin:$PATH"
  PYTHONPATH=/home/joel/Inoreader/src python3 run_example.py
  - Focus folder: The system now defaults to using your Focus folder, so make sure you have one set up
   in Inoreader with your important feeds.

  üéØ Quick Start:

  If you just want to get started immediately:
  python3 run_example.py

  This will handle everything for you interactively!

# Start daily scheduler
python3 run_cli.py schedule --time "10:00" --start

2200 utc is 0600 for SG time.
